When you click the "Make XML File" button, the program uses the following code to make such an XML file.
It opens an ADO Recordset connected to a normal Access database file. It then creates an XML DOMDocument 
object and calls the Recordset's Save method, passing it the DOMDocument to save the Recordset's data into the document.
It then calls the DOMDocument object's Save method to write the document's XML data into a file.

Private Sub cmdMakeXmlFile_Click()
Dim db_name As String
Dim conn As ADODB.Connection
Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset

    ' Get the database's name.
    db_name = txtDatabase.Text

    ' Open the connection.
    Set conn = New ADODB.Connection
    conn.ConnectionString = _

    ' Open the Recordset.

        "Title")

    ' Save the data into a DOMDocument.

    rs.Close

    ' Save the XML data into an XML file.
    db_name = Replace$(db_name, ".mdb", ".xml")
    dom_document.Save db_name
    MsgBox "Now move the XML file to a HTTP site."
